The R package [**REDCapDM**](https://bruigtp.github.io/REDCapDM/articles/REDCapDM.html) has been developed with the objective of facilitating the management of data for projects using the REDCap platform. It is capable of supporting both direct data export and access via the REDCap API. REDCapDM offers a comprehensive variety of functions, including the ability to preprocess data, generate detailed query reports for issues such as outliers or missing values, and track the resolution of each identified query.

[**REDCap**](https://projectredcap.org) (Research Electronic Data CAPture) is a widely-used web application developed at Vanderbilt University for creating and managing online surveys and databases. It includes an API (Application Programming Interface) that serves as an interface allowing external applications to connect to REDCap remotely, and is used to programmatically retrieve or modify project data or settings within REDCap, such as importing or exporting data.
